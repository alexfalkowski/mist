Cloud automation for PINCHme

## Purpose

At PINCHme we believe that computers are better at doing repetitive tasks than humans are. So we want to automate as
much as possible

## Environment

These sections describe how the environment is set up.

### Elastic Beanstalk

Our platform of choice is Elastic Beanstalk to setup an environment one needs to use the [CLI](http://aws.amazon.com/code/6752709412171743) tool
so please have a look at how that works.
